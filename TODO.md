# TODO

## rewrite v1 data storage using sqlite3

- import v1 terms from logs
- sync v1 terms with user upload
- registering new dict entries when new books created
- sync dbterms with dbdefns
- make core engine load dbterms instead of loading tsv files

## improve v1 dict data

- fix wrong tags
- remove garbage entries (autogenerated by baidu/lac)
- import new entries generated before

## improve v2 core engine

- import all ptags and rules definitions to sqlite3 format
- create ui to view/edit the definitions
- update essential glossaries so results don't appear to be broken
- add back support to translate chapter titles

## update texts

- restore files from old disks

  - restore chapters from downloaded htmls
  - restore chapters from zipped entries? (compare sizes with the newer one)

- fix invalid multibytes sequence error (convert .txt file to bgk file)
- fix broken texts (long time ago some files were stored with translations alongside, should be removed)
- update metadatas for all cached chapters
- copy fg seed chapters from bg seeds (using hardlink?)
